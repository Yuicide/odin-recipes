        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A <strong>pancake</strong> (or <strong>hot-cake</strong>, <strong>griddlecake</strong>, or <strong>flapjack</strong>) is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, often frying with oil or butter. It is a type of batter bread.</p>
        <p>Pancakes may be served at any time of the day or year with a variety of toppings or fillings, but they have developed associations with particular times and toppings in different regions. In <em>North America</em>, they are typically considered a <strong>breakfast</strong> food and serve a similar function to waffles.</p>
