        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons mild yellow curry powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>3/4 cup plain yogurt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar</li>
            <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recipe Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix together coriander, curry powder, garam masala, garlic, salt, and pepper in a glass bowl. Add vinegar and yogurt and mix to combine. Transfer mixture to a large resealable plastic bag. Add chicken breasts to mixture, coat well, cover, and marinate for 8 hours, or overnight, in a refrigerator.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Discard marinade and cook until chicken breast is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side. Grill time will depend on thickness of chicken breast. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
